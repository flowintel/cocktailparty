- **Public Sources**: Sources can now be marked as `public`, allowing all users to fetch data without needing to subscribe first.

### Introducing Sinks
- **Sink Channels**: Introduction of `sinks` â€“ Redis channels where users can push data (more details coming in the next release).

### User Experience and Interface Improvements
- **Source Previews**: Display a sample of the latest 5 messages from each `source`, allowing users to preview content before subscribing.
- **Connection Indicator**: Addition of a Redis-instance connection indicator to provide real-time connectivity status.
- **Log Formatting**: Improved log formatting for better readability and troubleshooting.
- **IPv6 Support**: Full IPv6 support for modern networking compatibility.

### Role Management and Security
- **Default Role for New Users**: New users are automatically assigned to the `default` role, which allows access to public `sources` only.
- **Mass Subscription Management**: Admins can now subscribe and unsubscribe users in bulk, simplifying user management.

### Developer Tools and Features
- **Enhanced Flag and Dashboard Features**: `FunWithFlags` and the Phoenix Dashboard are now active in production. Additionally, Mailbox Preview is enabled in the development environment.
