# Changelog for Cocktailparty v0.3 (Multisource beta)

Welcome to the latest update of Cocktailparty, that comes with a revamped brokering mechanism. While v0.2 was tied to redis-compatible connections, v0.3 brings the ability to connect to new types of sources:
 - STOMP source as for instance [UK national rail STOMP feed](https://wiki.openraildata.com/index.php/Connecting_with_Stomp), or [CERT.pl n6 notification system](https://cert.pl/en/n6/)
 - websocket sources as for instance [aisstream](https://aisstream.io/) 
 - redis and redis pubsub just as before
 - phoenix -- this is an crude support at the moment but cocktailparty instance can actually connect to other phoenix instances ;)

## Configuring connections
Connection configuration is now define through `yaml`, the interface reminding us of the required fields:

![connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20019d3a-a158-4e2f-b982-2f784962f388)

Only redis connections are capable of hosting sinks at the moment.

## Configuring sources
Source are tied to a connection and `required_fields` depends from connection to another.
For instance for certstream, the `mode` parameter will define what data will be pushed into the socket, 4 modes are available:
- `serialized_certificate_full`
- `serialized_certificate_lite`
- `certificate_lite`
- `dns_entries_only`

## Support for long-lived API keys
Until now Cocktailparty was reusing phoenix token, in v0.3 the application allows users to create long-lived API keys to access sources and sinks.

# What's next
- Improved documentation will follow,
- User-defined filters (and integration of Genstage) will be the next big development,
- [CIRCL's instance](https://cocktailparty.lu) is accept user registration.
